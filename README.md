# wordle_checker
a quick splunk dashboard I used to track previous solves

A while ago I noticed that they had not repeated wordle puzzle answers.  Recently I made this dashboard to help check if a word had been used before.  It goes with the included csv file.  It'll be up to the user to maintain the list as time progresses. I may periodically update the csv file here, but there is no guarantee.
